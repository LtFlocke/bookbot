# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

BookBot can evaluate data of a provided .txt file. It returns the total number of characters as well as an ordered list of the most common alphabetic characters.

Usage: python3 main.py

The Program will then ask to provide the name of the Book. It can analyze any book stored at /books/
